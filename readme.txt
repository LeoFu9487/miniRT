how to improve : solve linear_equations in polynominal time(right now it's O(n!))

remember to abandon in parsing when orientaion = (0,0,0)
need to do ambient lighting in math/utils.c, intersect_color
need to think get_new_brightness in math/utils.c 
for intersect_objects, deal with every element in t_intersect *
remember not to use have_intersection_* in intersect_*
todo : test linear_equations(double *u, double *v, double *w, double *ans)



usage :

1.

./miniRt <scene.rt> --save 

will save the picture as a bmp file

2.

./miniRT <scene.rt> 
will open a window
press space to start or change a camera
